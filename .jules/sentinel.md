## 2026-07-09 - Fix SQL Injection in NewsTypeMapper
**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection in ORDER BY clause in `NewsTypeMapper.java`. The `findByPage` method used `${sortBy}` and `${sortOrder}` directly which is vulnerable since it directly embeds user input into the SQL query.
**Learning:** MyBatis string interpolation `${}` is dangerous and allows SQL injection. While parameters can usually use `#{}` to be parameterized, `ORDER BY` clauses cannot.
**Prevention:** Avoid `${}` for dynamic sorting. Instead, use a `<choose>` block inside a `<script>` tag in the MyBatis mapper to enforce an allowlist for column names and sort directions.

## 2026-07-10 - Fix Authorization Bypass in SecurityConfig and NewsTypeController
**Vulnerability:** Authorization bypass via overly permissive `SecurityConfig` configuration. Endpoints like `/api/v1/categories/**` were globally permitted for all HTTP methods in `SecurityConfig.java`. Furthermore, modification endpoints (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) in `NewsTypeController` lacked method-level `@PreAuthorize` protections.
**Learning:** In Spring Security, using `requestMatchers("...")` without specifying an `HttpMethod` permits *all* HTTP methods for that path. Additionally, relying solely on path-based security configuration without defense-in-depth (method-level `@PreAuthorize` annotations on controllers) can lead to critical bypasses if the global configuration is flawed.
**Prevention:**
1. Always specify the explicit `HttpMethod` (e.g., `HttpMethod.GET`) when whitelisting public endpoints in `SecurityConfig`.
2. Implement defense-in-depth by always annotating modification endpoints (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) with method-level authorization (like `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")`), even if you believe global configuration restricts them.

## 2026-07-11 - Fix Hardcoded Password Logging in UserServiceImpl
**Vulnerability:** Plaintext user passwords and phone numbers were logged to the console using `System.out.println` during the login process in `UserServiceImpl.java`. This exposes highly sensitive authentication credentials to application logs.
**Learning:** Developers sometimes use `System.out.println` for debugging and forget to remove it before pushing to production, which easily leads to sensitive credential leaks. Standard logging mechanisms (e.g. SLF4J, Logback) should be used, but even then, sensitive data like passwords must *never* be logged.
**Prevention:** Never log passwords, tokens, or PII using `System.out.println` or standard logging frameworks; always strip or mask sensitive data before logging.
